Description:
Problem Statement: The dataset provided is related to IMDB Movies. A potential problem to investigate could be: "What factors influence the success of a movie on IMDB?" Here, success can be defined by high IMDB ratings. The impact of this problem is significant for movie producers, directors, and investors who want to understand what makes a movie successful to make informed decisions in their future projects.

Data Cleaning: This step involves preprocessing the data to make it suitable for analysis. It includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, converting data types if necessary, and possibly feature engineering.

Data Analysis: Here, you'll explore the data to understand the relationships between different variables. You might look at the correlation between movie ratings and other factors like genre, director, budget, etc. You might also want to consider the year of release, the actors involved, and other relevant factors.

Five 'Whys' Approach: This technique will help you dig deeper into the problem. For instance, if you find that movies with higher budgets tend to have higher ratings, you can ask "Why?" repeatedly to uncover the root cause. Here's an example:

Q: "Why do movies with higher budgets tend to have higher ratings?"
A: They can afford better production quality.
Q: "Why does better production quality lead to higher ratings?"
A: It enhances the viewer's experience.

Q: "Why are viewers more likely to rate a movie highly if they enjoyed watching it?"
A: Positive experiences lead to positive reviews.
Q: "Why do positive reviews matter?"
A: They influence other viewers' decisions to watch the movie, increasing its popularity and success.
Report and Data Story: After your analysis, you'll create a report that tells a story with your data. This should include your initial problem, your findings, and the insights you've gained. Use visualizations to help tell your story and make your findings more understandable.
